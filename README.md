# Music Hit Predictor
## Overview
Nowadays, streaming platforms dominate the music industry, with people spending an average of 75 minutes per day on platforms such as Spotify, Amazon Prime, and Youtube Music.

While streaming is immensely popular, there are millions of aspiring artists uncertain about their chances of success on platforms like Spotify. The mission of this project is to empower these artists, providing them with insights to help them thrive and turn their passion for music into a sustainable career.

## Project Details
To achieve this goal, I've developed an algorithm using a dataset from Spotify. This algorithm predicts whether a song has the potential to become a hit on Spotify. By leveraging data-driven insights, artists can make informed decisions about their music releases.

## Getting Started
To explore the predictions made by the algorithm, you can use the Streamlit app provided in app.py. The app offers a user-friendly interface to interact with the model and gain insights into the potential success of a song.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.


## Running the App
Execute the following command in your terminal to run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Access the app through your web browser to start exploring the predictions.

## Note
The provided app.py is a raw version of the Streamlit app. Feel free to enhance and customize it based on your preferences and requirements.
